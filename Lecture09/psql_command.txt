Using the BLAST data output blastoutput2.out that you generated in the BLAST lecture
try at least some of the following:

show the HSPs with more than 20 mismatches

s2449149=> select * from blastoutput where mismatches > 20;




show the HSPs shorter than 100 amino acids and with more than 20 mismatches
list the first 20 HSPs that have fewer than 20 mismatches
how many HSPs are shorter than 100 amino acids?
list the top ten highest (best) HSPs.
list the start positions of all matches where the HSP Subject accession includes the letters string "AEI"
how many subject sequences have more than one HSP?
what percentage of each HSP is made up of mismatches?
allocate HSPs into different groups based on their scores
